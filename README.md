# picoCTF  
Writeup for the PicoCTF Challenges  
This is part of my Cryptonite Student Project Task Phase 2.  
I was given 15 challenges (3 for each domain - Web, bin, rev, cryptography and forensics).  

Before doing the challenges I went through the Primer walkthrough to get an idea and understanding each domain.

It was really fun!!
