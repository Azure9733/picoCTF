So I refered the article: 'https://phpdelusions.net/articles/paths'
From here i was able to understand the difference between absolute filepaths and relative file paths as well as how to access them
I used the following input to get the flag: '../../../../flag.txt'
Flag:  picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}
