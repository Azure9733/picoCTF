## Challenge: Forbidden Paths  
After reading the statement provided. I had to first understand what exactly are absolute file paths and file paths in general.  
So I refered the article: 'https://phpdelusions.net/articles/paths'.  
From here i was able to understand the difference between absolute filepaths and relative file paths as well as how to access them.  
I used the following input to get the flag: '../../../../flag.txt'.

Flag:  picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}  
## Challenge: caas  
I visited the website provided 'https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/' and open the cowsay link  
It seems the cowsays whatever i gave as input.  
Then i used the webshell to wget the index.js file and read it.

I tried to use the ls and pwd command as a message but it did not give any response and just echoed the same output.

I was not getting any leads from looking at the javascript code either so I had to look up a writeup.  
I referred 'https://www.ctfwriteup.com/picoctf/picomini-by-redpwn/web-exploitation' and found that i was missing a simple semicolon.
I used 'https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/mooo%20;ls' and https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/mooo%20;cat%20falg.txt'
