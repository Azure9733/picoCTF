## Challenge: Forbidden Paths  
After reading the statement provided. I had to first understand what exactly are absolute file paths and file paths in general.  
So I refered the article: 'https://phpdelusions.net/articles/paths'.  
From here i was able to understand the difference between absolute filepaths and relative file paths as well as how to access them.  
I used the following input to get the flag: '../../../../flag.txt'.

## Challenge: caas  
I visited the website provided 'https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/' and open the cowsay link  
It seems the cowsays whatever i gave as input.  
Then i used the webshell to wget the index.js file and read it.

I tried to use the ls and pwd command as a message but it did not give any response and just echoed the same output.

I was not getting any leads from looking at the javascript code either so I had to look up a writeup.  
I referred 'https://www.ctfwriteup.com/picoctf/picomini-by-redpwn/web-exploitation' and found that i was missing a simple semicolon.
I used 'https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/mooo%20;ls' and https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/mooo%20;cat%20falg.txt'

This is called Command Injection
## Challenge: Local Authority  
I visited the given website 'http://saturn.picoctf.net:49386/' and found that the password can be stolen because of insecure connection.

I then followed the learn more hyperlink and read the mozilla blog and the next blog at the 'note for developers' section.  
'https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/insecure-password-warning-firefox?as=u' & 'https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/insecure-password-warning-firefox?as=u'  
Did not find anything useful. So, i checked the source code of the website.  
I found 2 links further inside the code. 'style.css' and 'login.php'.  
The former just had the background setting but the latter had alot more interesting stuff.  
There were 2 more links inside other than the 'style.css' - 'secure.js' and 'admin.php'.  
Secure.js contained the admin username and password which i used to get the flag.
